	Good Beer Bad Movie instructions.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Use the GBBM engine to find a movie and beer pairing that is the most fun or the one that best suits your taste. For experts pick the pairing that is the most painful.</li>
	<li>Everytime you hit <a href="<?php echo url_for('@homepage') ?>" title="PAIE EM UP">PAIR 'EM UP</a> you might get something random or you might get one of our featured pairings. It's like a fortune cookie full of beer and zombies (maybe). If you are a control freak, you can browse our choices and create your own pairing with the <a href="<?php echo url_for('@pairingTypes') ?>" title="Make your own pairing">Make A Pairing</a> feature</li>
	<li>Go to your local reputable beer purveyor and purchase said beer. Make sure to get enough for your friends - don't be greedy!</li>
	<li>Add the horrible film to your Netflix queue, which, Guess what?! You can do on GoodBeerBadMovie.com! (By the way, you may want to stop sharing your queue now.  You don't want to be judged for your horrible taste, do you?)</li>
	<li>Share the chosen pairing via the "Like" and "Send" Facebook buttons. Call a bunch of your best friends (or worst enemies) and invite them over to your house for movies and beer.</li>
	<li>Pop in the DVD and begin drinking. Hilarity will ensue. It is a fact.</li>
	<li>Tell everyone about your GoodBeerBadMovie.com pairing on our comment boards.</li>
</ol>
